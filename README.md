# QUANTUM-TRADE
Trading with Quantum IBM QISKIT 

## Inspiration
Our team was wanting to learn Quantum Computing for a long time and we wanted to learn how to create quantum circuits on IBM's Quantum service, Qiskit, so we wanted to try to learn them and make something useful out of it. We also wanted to try IBM's Quantum Challenge and thus decided to create something with the help of Qiskit.

## What it does
It is an app that helps you predict the best stocks with the help of Qiskit using an Algorithm.

## How we built it
To make the program, we would need to both works on the quantum code, so that the program can actually work and function, and also to create a guided user interface to enable the user to actually be able to use our program. We used python to code and we used the Qiskit Software Development Kit. In terms of creating a user interface, we used Tkinter.

## Challenges we ran into
Running the quantum computer in an I7 laptop and running the GUI took a long time. This was our first time trying to apply qiskit in a useful way and hence it was really challenging for us

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The implementation of the entire project helped us realize the importance of collaboration and the dynamics of working in a team. In every Hackathon, proper time management ⏰plays a crucial role that can become a determining factor for the overall progress. We understood the instrumentality of following the code of conduct ✨and treating fellow developers with respect while learning and improving through their feedback. We are proud of completing the project in time.

## What we learned
We learned about Quantum Computing and Qiskit Software Development Kit.

## What's next for Quantum Trade
We want to add more features to the app.
